This is my first blog post ever. I will be adding whatever I read or learned about during that day.
I am currently reading a book called `How to Read A Book` by Adler et al. I came across it randomly on the Internet and read about how helpful it was in improving one's reading comprehension.
Reading is an activity we take for granted. It is something we do passively without giving much thought. 
The book argues that the previous sentence couldn't be more wrong. In fact, it is just as active as writing or speaking. The more effort put into reading, the more we get out of it.

The book also emphasizes reading for understanding as opposed to reading for entertainment or for information. In contrast to reading for entertainment or information, reading for understanding forces the reader to elevate oneself from a position of lower understanding to that of a higher one.
Committing regularly to reading books that are, at first glance, hard to comprehend is crucial for improving one's reading comprehension. With this in mind, I strive to read for at least 30 minutes a day, whether it be a self-help book, a tech book, or a novel.

Why don't we all open up a book and read for 10 minutes before bed tonight?
